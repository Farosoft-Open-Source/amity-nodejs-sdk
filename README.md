## Installation

To get started with the AMITY SOCIAL SDK, you can simply install it using npm (https://your-package-manager-link.com). Here's how you can do it using [example package manager]:

```bash
npm install your-api-sdk
```

Or if you're using [another package manager]:

```bash
yarn add your-api-sdk
```

## Usage

Using the AMITY SOCIAL SDK in your project is straightforward. First, import the SDK into your code:

```javascript
const { YourAPIClient } = require('your-api-sdk');

// Create a client instance
const client = new YourAPIClient();
```

## Authentication

Before you start making API requests, you'll need to set up authentication. The AMITY SOCIAL SDK supports various authentication methods, including API keys and OAuth tokens. Here's an example of how to set up API key authentication:

```javascript
const { YourAPIClient } = require('your-api-sdk');

// Create a client instance with API key
const client = new YourAPIClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```

Please refer to our official documentation for more information on authentication methods and how to set them up.

## Examples

### Making a GET Request

```javascript
// Fetch resource by ID
const resourceId = '123';
const resource = await client.getResourceById(resourceId);
console.log('Resource:', resource);
```

### Making a POST Request

```javascript
// Create a new resource
const newResource = {
  name: 'New Resource',
  // other properties
};

const createdResource = await client.createResource(newResource);
console.log('Created Resource:', createdResource);
```

You can find more usage examples and detailed API documentation in our [official documentation](https://link-to-your-documentation.com).
